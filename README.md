# Design-Challenge-1-landing-page

This is my completed rendition of a code challenge posed by the incredible folks at Good Code (https://moeminm.github.io/goodcode/#challenges)

From their single wireframe (see <b>desi.gn landing page.png</b>) I rendered the design as faithfully as possible in HTML and CSS. I made decisions for sensible responsive design and good user experience. You can see a live demo here: https://hannah-vdw.github.io/Design-Challenge-1-landing-page/

JS functionality comes in for user interactions with buttons and other page elements.

In the end this was a fun challenge for practicing HTML, CSS and some simple DOM interaction. Although there were some minor elements of the original design I would have changed I liked the exercise of recreating a wireframe accurately.
